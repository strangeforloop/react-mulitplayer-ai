# React Multiplayer AI Game
This is a dynamic game that allows users to choose whether they want to play a game with either a 3x3 or 4x4 board.<br>
If the user choses a 3x3 board, they have the option to play against a human or an AI player.
<br><br>
The AI player uses the MiniMax algorithm, a backtracking algorithm that will always find the optimal move.
